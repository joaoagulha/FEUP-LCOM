## Disclaimer
 - This repository's code, as so happens with every other repository, is meant for educational and sharing purposes. 
 - Personally, I do not take any accountability over any code flaws. 
 - To those with the intention of copying this code for your school projects, keep in mind that this repository is public and also the professors have access to past projects so most likely they will find out similarities and will be forced to fail you for copying.
 - That being said, feel free to take ideas
